    In order to publish my blog posts
    As a blogger
    I need to have auto routes for them

    Background:
        Given the database is empty
        And there is a blog named "Testing blog"

    Scenario: Publishing blog post
        When I publish a new blog post on "2014/03/22" called "1 year Routing Auto"
        Then the route "/blog/testing-blog/2014/03/22/1-year-routing-auto" should be created

    Scenario: Renaming blog post
        Given I published a blog post on "2014/03/22" called "1 year Routing Auto"
        When I rename "1 year Routing Auto" to "1 year of auto routing"
        Then the route "/blog/testing-blog/2014/03/22/1-year-of-auto-routing" should be created
        And the route "/blog/testing-blog/2014/03/22/1-year-routing-auto" should not exists

    Scenario: Deleting blog post
        Given I published a blog post on "2014/03/22" called "1 year Routing Auto"
        When I delete "1 year Routing Auto"
